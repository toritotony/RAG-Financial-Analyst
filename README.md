# RAG Analyst - Asset Comparison & Predictive Report Generator

RAG Analyst is a Python-based application designed to automate the collection and analysis of financial data. It leverages advanced web scraping and machine learning techniques to generate insightful reports. These reports include asset outlooks and comparative analyses, integrating both qualitative and quantitative data sourced from [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com). When certain data is unavailable, the tool adapts to provide the most accurate assessment possible based on existing information.

## Features
- **Automated Data Collection**: Scheduled scripts scrape price changes and financial news articles.
- **Vector Database Integration**: Stores processed data in a vector database for efficient querying and retrieval.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Combines textual analysis with numerical data for detailed financial insights.
- **Adaptability**: Dynamically adjusts reporting based on data availability for specified time periods.
